I didn't use an IDE to create my billiards game, I just used a text editor.

To compile and run the game, run

    $ make
    $ bin/billiards

The game compiles on Linux and Mac OSX with SDL2 installed. It's probably
possible to port it to Windows, but I haven't tried to yet.

The game's instructions are printed to the console at startup, but I will
reproduce them here:

    How to Play:
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     - To launch the cue-ball, place the cursor over the intended
       direction, then left-click. The power of the shot is determined
       by the bar on the right-hand side of the screen.
     - Press "R" to reset the balls to their starting positions.
     - Press "F" to freeze the balls in their tracks!
     - Press "Escape" or "Q" to exit.
